# email-generator
Hey Connections this is a Sunday mini project which I built using python, streamlit.

Libraries used: streamlit, openai, langchain, tiktoken

LLM: GPT-4o


How to use:
1. Get an openai key from the main website
2. Paste the key
3. Enter : 1. what the email is about
	 	2. Who you are sending this email to
		3. the Length of the email
		4. The tone of the email
4. Click generate email

Result: The email will be generated along below. The tokens used and the cost (in usd and inr) will also be displayed in the sidebar.

Cheers :)
